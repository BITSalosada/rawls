# Rawls Rampup

## Introduction

Welcome to Rawls Rampup! The aim of this project is to introduce new developers to Rawls by implementing a variety of features across the codebase. This will not only touch on the main areas of Rawls but also some of the Scala idioms and patterns we use.

We assume you've been given a gentle introduction to Workbench as a whole. If you haven't, stop and get that now!

As you progress through these exercise, *please please* ask the team if you have any questions or comments. We're very happy to explain anything, provide context, go into more detail, or even have philosophical discussions!
